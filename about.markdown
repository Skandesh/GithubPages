Oftentimes we are confined to our ideas/beliefs `(1+1=2)` & when something out-of-oridinary comes up `(1+1=10)` we ignore it instead of exploring/truly understanding, and it might not give you any monetary value, dopamine or fame, rather you'd be exposed to something which you haven't thought of and your perspective shifts permenantly adapting to the idea if you truly understood.
      If you practice this for a prolonged period, you'd be full of life & end result coming out of you be would either extaordinarily beautiful or full of chaos! (depends on the ideas you're exposed to) 

    
**TL;DR** - It makes perfect sense in binary system!
